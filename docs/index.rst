PyFluidBearing: Open-Source Software for Fluid Bearing Calculations
===================================================================

pyFluidBearing is an open-source Python library for fluid film bearing analysis.

The objectives of this library are as follows:

1. Provide easy and reproducible tools for evaluating fluid film bearing performance, including load capacity, stiffness, damping, and pressure distribution
2. Enable comparison of analytical, numerical, and data-driven approaches for modeling and analyzing bearing behavior
